    <h3>Welcome to my narrative building app.</h3>
    <p>I have found that the power of a new story or an old one well told can not be underestimated. Putting a new spin on all of our childhood memories is the mainstay of Hollywood now. Too often in the entertainment products we consume the alure is all sizzle and minimal substance. I felt like half the time whatever I was reading/ playing/ watching had only the briefest attention paid to the story. This is especially symptomatic of the gaming industry. I understand that the man hours put into the project are focused on the very important goal of a solid minimum viable product and added user functionality, however too often the inner story of why you picked up the game/movie is only addressed in perfunctory fashion. </p>
    <p>With that being said I created this tool to help an author build their narrative outline. The app is designed to take the classic 8 point story arc and give guidance to the author with examples and simple structure.</p>
