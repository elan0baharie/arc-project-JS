## Description

_I created this tool to help an author build their narrative outline. The app is designed to take the classic 8 point story arc and give guidance to the author with examples and simple structure. The minimum viable product has been designed to allow the user to create their plot outline with some examples of a few great stories._

* _Import the master-seed.json into Firebase to create the info the app needs._
